# java-evaluation

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jjYBdx4IL/java-evaluation.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jjYBdx4IL/java-evaluation)

The test units in this module should be viewed as examples about how stuff
works. Whenever I have issues to get something working properly, I try to
put it in here and try to understand how a simpler variant of the problem
works.

## TestAutorunGUI

Run

    mvn exec:java -Ptestgui

to start up a GUI that will re-run a selected test unit as soon as
a change in its class is detected. Btw if you are using NetBeans, don't
run this command from within NetBeans as it will disable compile-on-save.
